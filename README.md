What does this do?
==================
This is a package for Sublime Text 3 which adds syntax hightlighting, snippets and completions for Shaders used by the [Unity3D Engine](http://unity3d.com/).

Currently the following features are included:

- Highlighting of `.shader` and `.cginc` files
	- Highlights most keywords, variables, strings and comments
	- Uses C++ highlighting (with a few additional keywords) inside `CGPROGRAM`/`ENDCG`
- Simple snippets for creating properties
- Highlighting of `.compute` files
	- Uses C++ highlighting with a few additional keywords added

DISCLAIMER
==========

The syntax highlighting is rather incomplete.
If there are any syntax errors you encounter or any features you want added please don't hesitate to create an issue.
